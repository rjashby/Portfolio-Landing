  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I believe that my life experiences have shaped who I am today, and the person I'm meant to be. Through my eclectic past experiences, I've worked and learned in a variety of collegiate, professional, and worldly settings.</p>
  <p>These experiences have taught me invaluable lessons on appreciating and embracing my life as a forward journey. I'm never as great as my greatest accomplishment, and I'm never as inadequate as my lowest low.</p>
  <p>I am an amalgamation of my experience, and I treasure the wisdom I have gained to know what I know, and more importantly, what I do not. I will never stop striving to be a better individual so that I may better the lives of myself and those around me.</p>
